# Hi, I'm Jan 👋🏻
## 🧑🏼 About Me
- 🏠 I'm a student from Germany
- 🧠 I'm interested in front-end-development and UI/UX design
- 🛠️ I’m currently working on a [studypilot](https://www.studypilot.app)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning [@Flutter](https://github.com/flutter)

## My Projects in the past 🔙

- 👖 I worked with React to create a PWA called ["MyCloset"](https://github.com/ATJanKaczmarek/todo-teams-app). It's a little unfinished app to organize your garments.
- 🎮 I worked a lot with Unity3d. This way I learned programming. [This is a little sideproject of mine](https://github.com/ATJanKaczmarek/airport-idle-game).
- 🧑🏼‍💻 I made some websites [like this one](https://atjankaczmarek.github.io/pizzaria-concept/), when I started web-development.
